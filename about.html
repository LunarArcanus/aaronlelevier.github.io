    <p>
      My name is Aaron Lelevier, and this is my blog. The goal of this blog is to start sharing the software engineering information that I've accumuated over the last 5 years and from now going forward.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Professional experience
    </h2>

    <p>
      Currently, I got laid off due to downsizing. So, I will be occupying my time by creating public consumable content in the form of software or things related to software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I worked as a full stack web developer using <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and some frontend <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/">EmberJs</a> Javascript at <a href="https://servicechannel.info/">ServiceChannel</a> based out of San Diego, CA. Prior to this, I worked as a MS SQL Senior Database Analyst at <a href="https://hardrockhotel.com/">The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino</a> in Las Vegas, NV.

      If you are hiring and think that I would be a good fit based upon what you see, please get in touch with me.

    <h2>
      Who I am as a person
    </h2>

    <p>
      I am an ongoing learner. I heard a good quote from a software developer here in San Diego. He said:
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        I started by reading one computer book. Then I never stopped.
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      I like to read Computer Science books. I also like watching tech talks on YouTube. Everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQX1tChV7Z7l1LFF4L9j_g">InfoQ</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conf</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw">Google Developers </a> channel. I bought 5 math books from <a href="http://www.powells.com/">Powell's Books</a> (this bookstore is amazing, if you are in Portland it is a must!) on my recent trip there for <a href="https://emberconf.com/">EmberConf 2018</a>. I have a backlog of things to learn. It's a prioritized backlog though, don't worry!
    </p>

    <p>
      My older daughter once told me, "you could be a motivational speaker on <b>YouTube</b>". So, maybe there will be some of that in this blog. I do like motivational quotes, and am one of those people that always tries to be positive about everything, no matter what it is, so that is bound to come out in my writing.

      This site is currently like the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?TracerBullets">Tracer Bullets</a> concept in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a>.

    </p>

    <h2>
      Meetups
    </h2>

    <p>
      I sometimes speak at meetups. I spoke in November 2017 at San Diego Python on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/ztnwjnywpbfc/">Mocking in Python</a>, here is the <a href="https://github.com/aaronlelevier/mocking-in-python"> Github repo with the slides</a>.

    <p>
      I also spoke in February 2018 at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sandiegojs/events/ktlwfpyxdbjb/">San Diego Js</a> about my experience building a simple <a href="https://github.com/aaronlelevier/ember-slot-machine">Slot Machine app in EmberJs</a>.

      Ok, back to the blogging... I may also blog on Machine Learning from the things that I learned <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and the things that I'm doing on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/aronysidoro">Kaggle</a> to name a few. Please stay tuned. Thanks!
