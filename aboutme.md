My name is Aaron Lelevier. I am married with 4 kids. I enjoy spending time with my family, the outdoors, building a fixing things, and computer science, just to name a few.

I've been using Python for 5 years. Currently I am a Python Developer at [ServiceChannel](https://servicechannel.info/). We're working within a distributed system architecture. It has both been fun and challenging.

Overlapping that, I was using MS SQL for 4 years, during which time I was a Sr. Database Analyst at [The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino](https://hardrockhotel.com/).

### Recently

I am recently doing Machine Learning and am half way through [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
